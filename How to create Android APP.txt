Open details
Your car expense management app is ready! Here's what was built:

Database
Created a secure car expenses database with user authentication and row-level security, so users can only access their own expense data.

Authentication
Built login and signup screens with email and password authentication. The app automatically routes users to the correct screen based on their authentication state.
