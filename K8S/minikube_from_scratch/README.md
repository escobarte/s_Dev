# This section will be for MINIKUBE only

**DO: 24/09/2025**
**Working on Server 93.7"**
[+] Check if Minikube is installed, if yes remove it
[+] Create separted LVM for Minikube
[+] Install Minikube
[+] Do practice with minikube

**DO: 25/09/2025**
*For Beginners - Start with These 8:*
```
Pod - The basic unit
Deployment - Run your apps
Service - Expose your apps
ConfigMap - Store configuration
Secret - Store passwords/keys
PersistentVolumeClaim - Request storage
Namespace - Organize resources
Ingress - HTTP routing
```

**So what i did:**
```
POD
DEPLOYMENT
PVC = Persistent Volumes
YAML Manifests 
```
*Not undestood*
**Services ?**

What's Next - Brief Overview
Based on our original roadmap, here's what remains:
Already Completed:

✅ Environment setup
✅ Core concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services)
✅ Storage (PV, PVC)
✅ ConfigMaps & Secrets
✅ Namespaces
✅ Advanced YAML (multi-container, probes, resources)
✅ Production patterns

Remaining Topics:
1. Ingress Controllers

Expose multiple services through single entry point
URL-based routing (example.com/api → API service, example.com/web → Web service)
SSL/TLS termination

2. StatefulSets

For stateful applications (databases, Kafka, Elasticsearch)
Stable network identities and persistent storage
Different from Deployments

3. DaemonSets & Jobs

DaemonSet: Run one pod per node (logging agents, monitoring)
Jobs: Run-once tasks (backups, batch processing)
CronJobs: Scheduled tasks

4. Advanced Networking

Network Policies (firewall rules between pods)
Service mesh concepts
DNS resolution in Kubernetes

5. Monitoring & Logging

kubectl logs, describe, events
Resource monitoring (kubectl top)
Debugging failed deployments

6. Helm (Package Manager)

Templating for reusable deployments
Managing complex applications
Chart repositories
```


**Also, Hones Assessment**
```
Honest Assessment: 6/10
Here's the breakdown:
What you do well (Strong areas):

Understanding core concepts (Deployments, Services, Pods)
Architectural thinking (when to use what)
Asking the right questions
Learning from mistakes

What needs significant work:

YAML indentation (biggest weakness) - You consistently struggle with nesting levels. This causes 70% of your errors.
Syntax details - Typos like subPaht, prots, mixing up key vs value
ConfigMap vs Secret - Still confusing when to use which reference type
Structure memory - Forgetting where volumes goes, selector placement

Why 6/10 is accurate:

Your manifests don't work on first try
You grasp concepts but can't execute cleanly yet
In production, these errors would break deployments

The good news:
This is completely normal for someone learning Kubernetes. Most beginners are at 4-5/10 at this stage. Your conceptual understanding is ahead of your technical execution.
To reach 8-9/10:

Use a proper code editor with YAML validation (VS Code with Kubernetes extension)
Practice writing 20-30 more manifests
Always validate with kubectl apply --dry-run=client
Build muscle memory for indentation patterns

You're progressing well, but you need more repetition to eliminate the syntax errors. Keep practicing - the concepts are there, execution will follow.
